Unihandecode.js is a port of the `unihandecode`_ Python library by Hiroshi Miura and Tomaz Solc, which in turn is a port
of the Text::Unidecode Perl module by Sean M. Burke.

The purpose of this library is to transliterate unicode characters to ASCII, with support for complex characters
(Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese).
